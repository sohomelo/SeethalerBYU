Created in Eclipse with PyDev and Django plugins. I zipped the project folder.  The project is currently not runnable.

My previous attempt by creating a LAM(Python) server virtual machine and directly coding there failed with the virtual machine not booting after installing sshserver.  The code on that server was incomplete as well, as i was not able to find a way to get post data using raw python.
