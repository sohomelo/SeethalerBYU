Created in Eclipse with PyDev and Django plugins. The project is currently not runnable.  I should have probably stuck with PHP.

My previous attempt by creating a LAM(Python) server virtual machine and directly coding there failed with the virtual machine not booting after installing sshserver.  The code on that server was incomplete as well, as i was not able to find a way to get post data using raw  python.  I also had not worked in AWS bucket, or been able to completely test the GITHUB api code that i had written.
